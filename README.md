# Selenium Java Maven Framework with Cucumber 

### Cucumber is a exclusive BDD Framework for test automation and Java-TestNG is used with Cucumbers 

#### I have Developed a hybrid framework, so that means on top of our existing Java testing framework with Selenium libraries I have incorporate Cucumber into this framework. Our Framework will support both cucumber tests as well as the existing Java testNG test. See detail technoloigies used below:

#### Technologies: Java, Maven, TestNG Listeners, Extent Reports, Cucumber with Smart Feature files and Step definition files, Data Driven and Page Object framework concepts used & Base Test class for browser configuration and global properties

* Created Maven Structured Framework with all necessary Automation dependencies 
* Select Sample Ecommerce Application to Automate the end-to-end flow 
* Implement Page object Model mechanism to drive the locators from respective classes 
* Drive object creation within Page object classes encapsulating it from Tests 
* Create Base Test which sets browsers configuration details and Global properties 
* Decide the Test Strategy, how tests should be clubbed & distributed with appropriate annotations 
* Create TestNG runner file to trigger the tests with one Single point of execution control 
* Introduce Grouping in TestNG.xml to categorize tests with different tags of execution 
* Implement Data driven testing & Parameterization using TestNG Data provider HashMap & Json File readers 
* Implement TestNG Listeners to capture Screenshot on automatic test failures and logging 
* Create Extent Report wrapper to generate excellent HTML reports for the application 
* Make Framework necessary changes to support parallel execution with Thread safe mechanism 
* Implement TestNG retry mechanism to rerun the failed flaky tests in the application 
* Run the Framework tests with Maven commands with TestNG Maven integration plugin 
* Implement Maven Run time variables to replace global parameters of test date at run time (
* Integrate the Framework with Jenkins with Parameterized Build Pipeline Jobs & Schedule the job on specific time frames 
* Add Cucumber Wrapper to existing framework with Cucumber TestNG Runner  
* Create Feature files & Step definitions to support Cucumber execution of Selenium Tests 
* Understand how cucumber tags, Data driven & Parameterization works in running the tests.
